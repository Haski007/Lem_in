# Lem_in
My non-commercial project for UNIT factory.

Used BFS algorithms, and queue's way to check list.

A goal of this project is to launch ants through generated map to the END room. The only one ant can be located at 1 room.

Firstly use generator to create map:
./generator --help > [file]

Then use my program ./lem-in < [file]

There are some bonus flags, you can use ./lem-in -h for usage.
